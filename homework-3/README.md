This is my third homework in which I had to make chess pieces,and I also created a chess board.For the pieces I used revolve ,extrude and also fillet and chamber in order to design the pieces.<br/>
The table was easily made,however I had some issues with appearances until I discovered the split face option. This motivated to check more of what Fusion 360 has ,other than extrude,press pull,etc.
I also learned about patterns with this homework,which helped me a lot.
