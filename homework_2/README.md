As homework,we had to download a model from Thingivers and try to modify it ,and also to design the models A1,A2,A3,A4.Each model will have a different file in which you will find the .f3d file ,the .stl file ,the model itself, and also the gcode and printscreens from prusa slicer.
Also,the model from Thingivers that I chose was a classic phone stand created by Jebsta (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:476834) and i decided to add two pillars with an intersting model,in order to look good and also give the phone stand more stability.
