# 3DMP
This is my repository for the course "Introduction to 3D Modeling and Printing" that I take. In here you will find my homeworks but also my projects from the courses and laboratories.
While I am new to this , I intend to learn everything that I can ,considering how intersting it appears for me to print and model in 3D. In order to learn more ,I also intend to have separate projects that are not related to this course (which will appear in the future in the "alt" branch) in order for me to see my progress not only from my homeworks ,but also from creating objects from my imagination.
