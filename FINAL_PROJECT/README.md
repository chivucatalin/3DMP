 3D PRINTED SHREDDER MACHINE
==========
This mechanism is my final project for the course "Printing and Modelling 3d".The usage of the mechanism is pretty simple:you can shred up certain things like paper,bananas,etc . I chose this mechanism for two reasons: the first one is that I wanted to choose something practical ,and everyone can agree that a shredder can be pretty useful. The second reason is a silly one : the shredder that was in the presenting video (which will be mentioned later) reminded me of an old shredder toy that I used to love when I was a kid , so I just had to create it, for the nostalgia.

How it works:
------------------------------
First , I will list all of the components :

- Mainbody--it is obtained from a lower part and a upper part that are glued together
- Support frame
- Feeding port
- Shredder shaft (two of them)-one also acts as an connecting rod for the crank
- Crank 

As an extra detail , I also added:
- Trashbin,which will have all of the shredder discharges
