This is the 4th homework at 3d printing and modelling.I had to create 2 mechanism based on the scotch yoke mechanism and another one by choice (https://i.pinimg.com/originals/63/68/cf/6368cf88c25e49c6efcc0602a55cef72.gif). The mechanism printing is definitely harder than what i usually made (a reason is also because of the joints,thus u need to make sure the mechanism is working properly) but I will try to understand the mechanism better with time.
